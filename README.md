portfolio website

Fashion design portfolio I created for a friend. Implemented entirely with vanilla JavaScript and a little JQuery.
Learned to make use of image compression and AWS' Cloudfront service in order to speed up load times.
Learned how to make a responsive website that looks good on screens of various sizes.
